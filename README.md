## Onboarding Analyzer AI Agent

An AI-powered tool designed to help universities, training platforms, and organizations quickly understand why users drop off during onboarding. The agent automatically analyzes datasets, identifies problem areas, and visualizes insights in an easy-to-understand way.



## Features

- **CSV Upload**: Supports any CSV dataset, whether student onboarding data or generic onboarding data.  
- **Automatic Column Detection**: Identifies relevant columns for analysis. If a "student" column is missing, the app still functions correctly.  
- **Drop-off Analysis**: Calculates overall drop-off percentage and identifies stage-wise drop-off.  
- **Reason Detection**: Highlights top reasons for drop-off at each stage.  
- **Visualizations**: Generates graphs and charts for easy interpretation of onboarding trends.  
- **Clustering**: Groups stages or reasons to identify patterns in drop-offs.  
- **Versatile**: Works with multiple datasets, not restricted to students only.
